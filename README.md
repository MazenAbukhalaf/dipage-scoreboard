# Di-Page Scoreboard


### Welcome!
The Di-Page scoreboard is an automatically-updating two-page scoreboard I've created for Arlington Community Media, inc.

## How to Install
Unfortunetely, this project only works on a local computer, for hosting reasons.

1. Download the newest version of this repo and extract it onto your computer
2. If you have a two-monitor graphics system, open `index.html` on your hidden monitor and `score.html` on your displayed monitor.
3. On `index.html`, you have the ability to change many settings about the displayed scoreboard. The displayed page will auto-update every 3 seconds.
